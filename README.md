# CO2-Emissions

The impact of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), on the earth's climate has become an increasingly important issue in recent years. CO2 emissions are produced by a variety of human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. Understanding how much CO2 each country is emitting is crucial in developing effective climate policies and mitigating the effects of climate change.

The CO2 emissions dataset provides a comprehensive overview of the amount of CO2 emitted by each country. The dataset includes information on CO2 emissions by country from 1960 to the present day. It covers all countries in the world and is compiled from various sources, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA).

The dataset can be used by researchers, policymakers, and the general public to gain insight into the relative contributions of different countries to global CO2 emissions. It can also be used to monitor changes in emissions over time and to assess the effectiveness of climate policies.

Overall, the CO2 emissions dataset is an important resource for understanding the global climate challenge and for developing strategies to mitigate the impact of CO2 emissions on our planet.
